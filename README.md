# Java_GwaCalcVer2System_FinalProj_Group2_BSCS2B
GWA Calculator System is a Java-based desktop application developed by BSCS 2B students of Bicol University Polangui for their Object-Oriented Programming finals project. Its primary purpose is to help students and administrators efficiently compute and manage a student’s General Weighted Average (GWA)
>>> Key Features
User Authentication: Secure registration, login, and password management to protect academic records.
Database Integration: Uses SQLite with JDBC for storing and retrieving student records.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Java Swing, offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
Student Dashboard: Allows students to input grades and units, compute their GWA, and view results instantly.
Admin Dashboard: Provides administrators with tools to add students, edit grades, delete records, and export data.
System Disclaimer: Ensures users understand the grading scale and responsibility in using the system.

>>> Objectives
Enable secure account management for users.
Apply OOP principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and reusability.
Ensure accurate GWA computation based on inputted grades and units.
Demonstrate practical integration of Java programming, GUI design, and database connectivity.

>>Technical Highlights
Language: Java
Framework: Java Swing (GUI)
Database: SQLite (via JDBC)
Core Algorithm: Weighted average computation using grade × unit, rounded to two decimal places.

>> Sample Output
Students can compute their GWA and receive recognition (e.g., President’s List for high achievers).

Administrators can export student records into text files for documentation.
